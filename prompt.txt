I want to create a streamlit application that analyzes cattle EPDs and compares epds to industry metrics. 
I want the streamlit app to have a sidebar.
I want the app to have the following page tabs,
1. Home
2. Herd Analaysis
3. Visualizations
4. Individaul Cattle Analaysis
5. Raw Data 
6. Logging

I want each tab to have its own seperate file that will be referenced in by the main file
I want each file to be able to call functions from the lib/ directory
On the home page I want to instruct the user to upload 2 files
1. the EPD file for the Herd
2. the cattlemax export file for the Herd
Also on the home page i want to show the status of the industry metrics and have a button to refresh them


On the culling tab
I want to create two dataframes that will be displayed to the user.
The first dataframe will be of the top perfomring cattle based on their composite score
The second will be of the bottom performing cattle based on their composite score
For each cow in the dataframe I want to list their name , registration number, their EPDs and composite score
The user will have a selection option to choose between All cattle, Active Sires, Active Dams , or Non-Parents.
Active sires are selected by the "CM_Type or Sex" == "B" and "CM_Date of Birth" > 2 years old
Active dams are selected by the "CM_Type or Sex" == "C" and "CM_Date of Birth" > 2 years old
Non-Parents are selected by the "CM_Date of Birth" >2 years old
When a selection is made for the type of cow (Active Sires, Active Dams, Non-Parents) you have to load the the paired industry 
frame with the industry metrics for the selected type of cow. For active dams the industry df is st.session_state.activeDamsPercentileRankDf
for active sires it is st.session_state.activeSiresPercentileRankDf for non-parents it is st.session_state.nonParentsPercentileRankDf.
When the filtereddf is displayed to the user I want to compare the cattle EPDs to the industry metrics for the selected type of cow.
If the cattle EPDs are above the industry metrics for the selected type of cow then the cattle EPDs will be highlighted in green.
If the cattle EPDs are below the industry metrics for the selected type of cow then the cattle EPDs will be highlighted in red.
To compare the the filtereddf to the industry metrics several of the EPDs are labled the same,such as CED, BW, WW, YW but Milk, total maternal and growth 
are not labled the same. 
In the filtereddf milk is "Milk" and in the industry metrics it is "MK".
In the filtereddf total maternal is "Total Maternal" and in the industry metrics it is "TM".
In the filtereddf growth is "Growth Idx" and in the industry metrics it is "Growth".
