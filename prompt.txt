I want to create a streamlit application that analyzes cattle EPDs and compares epds to industry metrics. 
I want the streamlit app to have a sidebar.
I want the app to have the following page tabs,
1. Home
2. Herd Analaysis
3. Visualizations
4. Individaul Cattle Analaysis
5. Raw Data 
6. Logging

I want each tab to have its own seperate file that will be referenced in by the main file
I want each file to be able to call functions from the lib/ directory
On the home page I want to instruct the user to upload 2 files
1. the EPD file for the Herd
2. the cattlemax export file for the Herd
Also on the home page i want to show the status of the industry metrics and have a button to refresh them
